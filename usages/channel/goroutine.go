// In Go, concurrent tasks are called goroutines. Other programming languages have a similar concept called threads.
// goroutines require less memory than threads, less time to start up and stop, so it will run more goroutines at once.
// A goroutine is a function that is capable of running concurrently with other functions.
// To create a goroutine we use the keyword go followed by a function invocation

// Goroutines allow for concurrency: pausing one task to work on others. And in some situations they allow parallelism.

// Channel two features are below.
// 1.Channels can be sent as parameters to different goroutines
// 2.Channels work as both a publisher and subscriber model.
// There is a one-to-one relationship between the sender and the receiver of the data.
// If there’s no receiver, a message is stuck with the sender.

// Go statements can’t be used with return values, because there’s no guarantee the return value will be ready
// before we attempt to use it.

// The only practical way to use a channel is to communicate from one goroutine to another goroutine.
// Not only does channel allow you to send values from one goroutine to another, they ensure the sending goroutine
// has sent the value before the receiving goroutine attempts to use it.

// Channels do this by blocking—by pausing all further operations in the current goroutine.
// A send operation blocks the sending goroutine until a goroutine executes a received operation on the same channel.

// To send a value on a channel, use the <- operator.  "myChannel <- 3.14", send 3.14 to myChannel.
// use the <- operator to receive values from a channel.  "<- myChannel", receive values from myChannel.

// Go programs end when the main goroutine stops, even if other goroutines have not completed their work yet.

// A channel can be closed so that no more data can be sent through it.

// The greeting will include third, fifth and seventh outputs.
func greeting(exampleChannel chan string, content string) { // Take a channel as a parameter
	exampleChannel <- content // Send a value to the channel

	fmt.Println(exampleChannel, content)
}

func firstWayCreateChannel() chan string {
	firstWayChannel := make(chan string) // Create a new channel and declare a variable at once.

	return firstWayChannel
}

func secondWayCreateChannel() chan string {
	var secondWayChannel chan string // Declare a variable to hold a channel

	// created an object of type channel that can be used to transfer string data within the goroutines.
	secondWayChannel = make(chan string)

	return secondWayChannel
}

// Check the output sort, you will know during the channel read and write, how the channel block works.
func main() {
	firstWayChannel := firstWayCreateChannel()

	// This output is the fifth. Pass the channel to function running in a new goroutine
	go greeting(firstWayChannel, "firstWayChannel")

	// Telling the main function to keep waiting until the channel receives the data.
	fmt.Println(firstWayChannel, "first print")

	When write or read data from a channel, that goroutine is blocked and control is passed to available goroutines.

	That’s where deadlock error occurs crashing the whole program.

	Receiver goroutine can find out the state of the channel using val,
	ok := <- channel syntax where ok is true if the channel is open or read operations can be performed
	and false if the channel is closed and no more read operations can be performed.
	A channel can be closed using close built-in function with syntax close(channel).
