// This func is used to prove a channel which is created has a buffer.
// It won't block, before the buffer is full.

// Using buffered channels and for range, we can read from closed channels. Since for closed channels,
// data lives in the buffer, we can still extract that data.

// Length of a channel is the number of values queued (unread) in channel buffer

// As many of you pointed out, the last value of active goroutines should be 1.

// Since send operation on a buffered channel is non-blocking (when not full), next fmt.Println statement executes.
// Go scheduler also schedule goroutines on fmt.Println statement due to blocking I/O operation,
// however, this operation is not always blocking.
// This is where the squares goroutine wake up again, runs the last iteration, prints the value in the channel
// using fmt.Println (again, this could be blocking), and dies.

/** When the buffer is full, any value sent to the channel is added to the buffer by throwing out last value
in the buffer which is available to read.
But there is a catch, read operation on buffered is thirsty.
That means, once read operation starts, it will continue until the buffer is empty.
Technically, that means goroutine that reads buffer channel will not block until the buffer is empty.
