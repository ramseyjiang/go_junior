/**
An interface is a set of methods certain values are expected to have.
Any type that has all the methods listed in an interface definition is said to satisfy that
interface.
A type that satisfies an interface can be assigned to any variable or function parameter
that uses that interface as its type.

A concrete type specifies not only what its values can do (what methods you can call on them), but also what
they are: they specify the underlying type that holds the value’s data.

To satisfy an interface, a type must have all the methods the interface specifies. Method names, parameter types
(or lack thereof), and return value types (or lack thereof) all need to match those defined in the interface.

If you’ve assigned a value of a concrete type to a variable with an interface type, you can use a type assertion
to get the concrete type value back. Only then can you call methods that are defined on the concrete type
(but not the interface).

When you might use interface.
1. If there are certain methods you want to access without rewriting a lot of code, then you might need an interface.
2. If you need to mock up databases or external APIs in unit tests, then you might need an interface.
3. If you need to quickly plug different packages in and out of the code (like a logger) without a complete logic
	rewrite, then you might need an interface.
