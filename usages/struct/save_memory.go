We know that CPU 32-bit and CPU 64-bit are the most popular types of CPU.
Imagine that we have a CPU 64-bit, the CPU has transfer capability 64-bit data per clock cycle.
The clock cycle is how much time needed for CPU to process an information.

For example, when you go to a supermarket, you will have a trolley. The maximum capacity of the trolley
is the same as a cpu maximum process ability of each clock cycle.

In golang, data type and size list is following:
Data Type 			Size
bool				1 byte
int64				8 byte
string				16 byte
float32				4 byte
