	The only difference between a slice and an array is the missing length between the brackets.
	Slices are always associated with some array, and although they can never be longer than the array, they can be smaller.

	One way to create a slice,
	y := make([]float64, 5)

	The make function also allows a third parameter: x := make([]float64, 5, 10)

	Another way to create slices is to use the [low : high] expression:
	arr := [3]float64{1,2,3}
	x := arr[0:2]

	low is the index of where to start the slice and high is the index of where to end it,
	but not including the index itself.

	For convenience, we are also allowed to omit low, high, or even both low and high.
	arr[0:] is the same as arr[0:len(arr)], arr[:5] is the same as arr[0:5], and
	arr[:] is the same as arr[0:len(arr)].
